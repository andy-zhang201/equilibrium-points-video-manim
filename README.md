# phase-portrait-video
The main script in this repository creates an informational graphics animation that explains the usefulness of phase portraits for solving Ordinary Differential Equations. This script must be placed in a Manim environment before it can run to render the final video. The final video can be viewed through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29AygwhvrZs or you can download the .mp4 file from the repository.

This script renders an educational animation video using the Manim library by Grant Sanderson. It explains how to find the equilibrium points on a phase portrait for a first order ODE.
